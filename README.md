### Step 1: Updating all your software

First off, let's make sure that we are using a clean system. Run the apt updater.

```
apt-get update

```

### Step 2: Set up the repository

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS

```
apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -

```

Use the following command to set up the stable repository.

```
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

```

### Step 3: Install Docker CE

```
apt-get update
apt-get install docker-ce

```

### Step 4: Create a user

If you decide not to run Docker as the root user, you will need to create a non-root user.

**Warning: The docker group grants privileges equivalent to the root user.**

```
adduser user
usermod -aG docker user

```

Restart the Docker service.

```
systemctl restart docker

```

### Step 5: Test Docker

Run the Docker hello-world container to test if the installation completed successfully.

```
docker run hello-world

```

You will see the following output.

> Hello from Docker!
> 
> This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

### Step 6: Configure Docker to start on boot

Lastly, enable Docker to run when your system boots.

```
systemctl enable docker
```
